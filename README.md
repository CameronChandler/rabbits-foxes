# PyNBoids
### A recreation of the Boids simulation

This is my attempt at recreating a [Boids simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids "Wikipedia"), written in Python3 with Pygame2.

**To use**, save the `pynboids.py` file (and `nboids.png` if you want it's icon, not required) somewhere, and run via python.
I've included several tweakable settings near the top of the code. There you can adjust window size, fullscreen, fps, as well as whether boids avoid edges or wrap to the other side.
