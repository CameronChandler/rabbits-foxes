# PyNBoids
### A Python Boids Simulation

This is a [Boids simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids "Wikipedia"), written in Python3 with Pygame2.

**To use**, save the `pynboids.py` file (and `nboids.png` if you want it's icon, not required) somewhere, and run via python.
I've included several tweakable settings near the top of the code. You can adjust window size, fullscreen, fps, and how many boids to spawn, as well as whether boids avoid screen edges or wrap to the other side.. Change the background color, or turn the Boids into fish! ;)
